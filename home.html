                                <p><br><strong>The birth of Ganesha</strong></p>
                                <p>One day Goddess Parvati was at home on Mt.Kailash preparing for a bath. As she didn’t want to be disturbed, she told Nandi, her husband Shiva’s Bull, to guard the door and let no one pass. Nandi faithfully took his post, intending to carry out Parvati’s wishes. But, when Shiva came home and naturally wanted to come inside, Nandi had to let him pass, being loyal first to Shiva. Parvati was angry at this slight, but even more than this, at the fact that she had no one as loyal to Herself as Nandi was to Shiva. So, taking the turmeric paste (for bathing) from her body and breathing life into it, she created Ganesha, declaring him to be her own loyal son.</p>
                                <p>The next time Parvati wished to bathe, she posted Ganesha on guard duty at the door. In due course, Shiva came home, only to find this strange boy telling him he couldn’t enter his own house! Furious, Shiva ordered his army to destroy the boy, but they all failed! Such power did Ganesha possess, being the son of Devi Herself! </p>
                                <p>This surprised Shiva. Seeing that this was no ordinary boy, the usually peaceful Shiva decided he would have to fight him, and in his divine fury severed Ganesha’s head, killing him instantly. When Parvati learned of this, she was so enraged and insulted that she decided to destroy the entire Creation! Lord Brahma, being the Creator, naturally had his issues with this, and pleaded that she reconsider her drastic plan. She said she would, but only if two conditions were met: one, that Ganesha be brought back to life, and two, that he be forever worshipped before all the other gods.                         </p>
                                <p>Shiva, having cooled down by this time, and realizing his mistake, agreed to Parvati’s conditions. He sent Brahma out with orders to bring back the head of the first creature he crosses that is laying with its head facing North. Brahma soon returned with the head of a strong and powerful elephant, which Shiva placed onto Ganesha’s body. Breathing new life into him, he declared Ganesha to be his own son as well and gave him the status of being foremost among the gods, and leader of all the ganas (classes of beings), Ganapati.</p>
                            
                                <p><br><strong>Meaning of the story of  Ganesh</strong></p>
                                <p>At first glance, this story just seems like a nice tale that we might tell our children or a myth without any real substance. But, it’s true mystical meaning is veiled. It is explained thus:</p>
                                <p>Parvati is a form of Devi, the Parashakti (Supreme Energy). In the human body, She resides in the Muladhara chakra as the Kundalini shakti. It is said that when we purify ourselves, ridding ourselves of the impurities that bind us, then the Lord automatically comes. This is why Shiva, the Supreme Lord, came unannounced as Parvati was bathing.</p>
                                <p>Nandi, Shiva’s bull, who Parvati first sent to guard the door represents the divine temperament. Nandi is so devoted to Shiva that his every thought is directed to Him, and he is able to easily recognize the Lord when He arrives. This shows that the attitude of the spiritual aspirant is what gains access to Devi’s (the kundalini shakti’s) abode. One must first develop this attitude of the devotee before hoping to become qualified for the highest treasure of spiritual attainment, which Devi alone grants.</p>
                                <br><p>After Nandi permitted Shiva to enter, Parvati took the turmeric paste from Her own body, and with it created Ganesha. Yellow is the colour associated with the Muladhara chakra, where the kundalini resides, and Ganesha is the deity who guards this chakra. Devi needed to create Ganesha, who represents the earthbound awareness, as a shield to protect the divine secret from unripe minds. It is when this awareness begins to turn away from things of the world, and toward the Divine, as Nandi had, that the great secret is revealed.</p>
                                <p>Shiva is the Lord and Supreme Teacher. Ganesha here represents the ego-bound Jiva. When the Lord comes, the Jiva, surrounded as it is with the murky cloud of ego, usually doesn’t recognize Him, and maybe even ends up arguing or fighting with Him! Therefore, it is the duty of the Lord, in the form of the Guru, to cut off the head of our ego! So powerful is this ego, however, that at first, the Guru’s instructions may not work, as Shiva’s armies failed to subdue Ganesha. It often requires a tougher approach, but, eventually the compassionate Guru, in His wisdom finds a way.</p>
                                <p>Devi threatened to destroy the whole Creation after learning of Ganesha’s demise. This indicates that when the ego thus dies, the liberated Jiva loses interest in its temporary physical vehicle, the body, and begins to merge into the Supreme. The physical world is here represented by Devi. This impermanent and changeable creation is a form of Devi, to which this body belongs; the unchanging Absolute is Shiva, to which belongs the Soul. When the ego dies, the external world, which depends on the ego for its existence, disappears along with it. It is said that if we want to know the secrets of this world, which is a manifestation of Devi, then we must first receive the blessings of Ganesha.</p>
                                <p>Shiva restoring life to Ganesha, and replacing his head with an elephant’s, means that before we can leave the body, the Lord first replaces our small ego with a “big” or universal ego. This doesn’t mean that we become more egoistic. On the contrary, we no longer identify with the limited individual self, but rather with the large universal Self. In this way, our life is renewed, becoming one that can truly benefit Creation. It is however only a functional ego like the one Krishna and Buddha kept. It is like a thin string tying the liberated Consciousness to our world, solely for our benefit.</p>
                                <p>Ganesha is given dominion over the Ganas, which is a general term denoting all classes of beings, ranging from insects, animals and humans to the subtle and celestial beings. These various beings all contribute to the government of the Creation; everything from natural forces like storms and earthquakes to the elemental qualities like fire and water, to the functioning of the body’s organs and processes. If we don’t honour the Ganas, then our every action is a form of thievery, as it is unsanctioned. Therefore, instead of propitiating each Gana in order to receive their blessings, we bow to their Lord, Sri Ganesha. By receiving His grace, we receive the grace of all. He removes any potential obstacles and enables our endeavours to succeed.</p>
                                <p>Such is the greatness of Sri Ganesha! Jai Ganesha!</p> <a>Read less..</a>

The Vedas are four in number Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda respectively. The deities mentioned in Vedas are called Vedic Gods. Basically the Gods and Goddesses to whom saints, sages and common man of vedic age worshipped are the Vedic Gods. The oldest Hindu texts enumerate 33 principle Devas who were the guardians of Nature and Cosmic Creation. They are 33 in number – 12 Aditya, 8 Vasus, 11 Rudras and 2 Ashwini Kumar.</p></span>

                                        <p>The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in fact has a clear discussion between a rishi Vidagdha and the foremost authority of those times Rishi Yagnavalkya.

                                <p><br><strong>Gods of Hinduism</strong></p>
                                <p>According to the legend, Bhishma was a Vasu who was born upon earth because of a curse. It is said the eight Vasus once stole the divine cow, Kamadhenu (fulfiller of desires) from sage Vashista. With his mystic powers, the sage found out the culprits and cursed them to be born as human beings. Because of his curse, the eight Vasus took birth upon earth as children of Ganga. Seven of them died within a year of their birth, as per the curse of Vashista. The eighth one lived for long and became renowned as Bhishma the Great.</p>
                                <p>He was the grandfather of both the Pandavas and Kauravas and participated in the Mahabharata war. The names of eight Vasus changed over time. In the Bhagavadgita, Krishna says that among the Vasus, He is Pavaka. This name does not appear in the list of eight Vasus mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, namely Agni, Prithvi, Vayu, Antariksha, Aditya, Dyaus, Soma and Nakstrani. However, Pavaka is an epithet of Agni.</p>
                                <p>By the time of the Mahabharata, their names were replaced by Anala, Dhara, Anila, Aha, Pratyusha, Prabhasa, Soma and Dhruva. Although the names are different, in their essential meaning both the lists point to the same divinities. Anala is an epithet of Agni. Dhara is water. Anila is the earth. Aha is Vayu. Pratyusha is Aditya, the Sun. Prabhasa is Dyus, the dawn. Soma is the moon, Chandrama and Nakshatrani is Dhruva, the Pole Star. Symbolically, the eight Vasus represent the elemental forces and processes of Nature and the beings, namely earth, water, fire, air, light, weather, day, dawn, pole star, sun, moon, movement, support, transformation, digestion and so on. </p>
                                
                                <p>The symbolism within the story of the eight vasus is quite straightforward. The cow represents “divinity” or “wealth” (consciousness in other words), the wife (feminine principle) represents emotional desires and the eight vasus are subsequent energies. The seven energies that return to “paradise” after a short time reflect energy that passes through the chakras whilst Prabhasa is manifesting energy which always remains in Earth.</p>
                            
                                <p><br><strong>The Seven Chakras</strong></p>
                                <p>The chakras play a pivotal role in distributing energy in accordance with our thoughts, emotions and actions. How energy is distributed impacts on how we feel, shapes our personalities and manifests as our experience of reality.

                                    Therefore, because the eight vasus betrayed Rishi Vashishtas by stealing his cow, they are condemned for trying to obtain an experience born from desire. And oftentimes the actions we perform out of desire betray us and restrict us from obtaining higher consciousness.
                                    
                                    Despite Vashishtas leniency to the seven vasus, the brothers appeal to Ganga – the Mother of all Beings – for help. Ganga promises to give birth to them through her womb and free them of their curse in her waters. Ganga drowned the seven vasus and released them, but when she tried to deliver Prabhasa she was stopped by Vashishta’s curse.
                                    
                                    Prabhasa’s devotion to his wife (emotions of desire) became his undoing. He is later considered to be the cause of all suffering and the catalyst for the Kurukshetra war.
                                    
                                    Great wars in myth represent the battle you must face with yourself – with the demons of your subconscious mind that lead you to temptation. Desire drives us to commit actions that do not serve us. Sometimes we do not even deserve the objects of our desire.
                                    
                                    Consciousness has a divine plan for us. We can only reach our true potential by expanding conscious awareness and communicating with our higher conscious self – the gods of myth.
                                    
                                    The subtle energies which are represented by the eight vasus help us to attain higher states of consciousness. Wisdom must be kept pure, hence why the eight vasus are described as assistants to Indra and Vishnu.</p>
                                
                                    <p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                                    <p>The Ashta vasus who are the demi gods and friends of Lord Indra, contains all the powers to protect us. They are the ones who can give us all sorts of comforts in our life. They will be pleased by the performance of yagna. Whenever an Yagna is performed, their names will be chanted, and they will be happy and give their blessings immediately.</p>
                                    <p>There names are repeatedly recited while doing an yagna. Without chanting their names, an yagna cannot be completed fully. Hence let us pray to the divine gods for our well being and chant their nama and live happily and peacefully for ever.</p>

                                    <p><br>Name Of Ashta Vasus</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The eight vasus named in the Rig Veda are given below. Some of their names are changed slightly in the Upanishad Brihadaranyaka and completely in the Mahabharata. Regardless of the change in names, the demi-gods still have the same meanings:</p>
                            
                                    <p> <br><strong>Agni</strong> – the primary fire God of the Vedas, Agni is recognised as the principle destructive force in early myth. He was later replaced by the Supreme deity, Lord Shiva who was subsequently promoted to the Trimurti. Agni is both honoured and feared because of his ability to destroy in order to create.

                                    <p> <br><strong>Aha</strong> – there is little information about Aha other than he is “pervading.” He is also known as Antariksa in later myths, who is considered to be the “ether” or space God.</p>
                                        
                                     <p><br><strong>Dhruva</strong> – means motionless and is the name of the polestar named in ancient Sanskrit literature that is protected by the “Seven Sages” – the chakras.</p>
                                        
                                    <p><br><strong>Dyaus</strong> – the Sky God is described as wise energetic and righteous. Together with his consort, Prthivi (Mother Earth) is the Father of other gods and preservers of all creatures on Earth.</p>
                                        
                                    <p><br><strong>Prithvi</strong> – Mother Earth, the consort of Dyaus is associated with fertility, reproduction and supporting nature.</p>
                                        
                                    <p><br><strong>Soma</strong> – a moon god that provides inspiration to poets and confidence to warriors. He is also a hallucinogenic plant.</p>
                                        
                                    <p><br><strong>Surya</strong> – the sun God is known for his vitality and courage. He represents the light of the soul and rides a chariot drawn by seven horses indicating he has ties with the chakras.</p>
                                        
                                    <p><br><strong>Vayu</strong> – a destructive wind God that was once a member of the Holy Hindu trinity before being replaced by Shiva. Nevertheless, he is a constant companion of Vishnu and Lakshmi.</p>

Revered as eleven of the thirty-three gods in Vedic traditions, they possess distinct characteristics and associations that span various texts and mythological accounts.</p>

                                    <p>Rudra is one of the most popular names of Shiva used extensively in the Vedas to refer to him. In fact, an expression addresses him as Rudra Shiva. 
                                       The literal meaning of the term Rudra seems to be roaring storm. The other meanings associated with this word are fire and fiery red. Looking from several angles, 
                                       the term Rudra appears to focus on the fiery aspect of Shiva which is destruction. A paragraph in Rudrashtakam describes the Rudra nature of Shiva</p>
                                       
                                       <p style="color: red;"> <strong>Prachannddam Prakrssttam Pragalbham Paresham </strong>

                                       <br><strong>Tryah_Shoola Nirmoolanam Shoola paannim</strong>
                                        
                                       <br> <strong>Bhajeham Bhavaani _ patim ,Bhaava_gamyam  </strong> </p>

                                       <p>The meaning is: I bow to You Rudra , who is terrible , eminent amd extremely strong, who is the highest Lord. Who is ever Unborn and whole, 
                                        and has the brightness of million Sun’s. Who has a trident in his hand, the three spikes of which uproots the bondages of the three gunas/qualities namely Tamas, 
                                        Rajas and Sattva. I bow to you, the Husband of Devi Bhavaani , who can be attained by devotion.</p>

                                        <p>A puranic story narrates an incident associated with the term Rudra. Once Brahma asked Rudra to create some beings as he was getting bored by creating ordinary mortals.Owing to this request, Shiva created 11 immortal beings who are called Kapali, Pingala, Bhima, Virupaksa, Vilohita, Ajesha, Shasana, Shasta, Shambhu, Chanda and Dhruva. They were together called as 11 Rudras.Being the head of these immortal beings, Shiva is addressed as Rudra. The hymns of Rg Veda have a lot of references to Shiva in the name Rudra. They all portray Shiva as the highest God, a mighty archer, the most terrible form, the fire god and so on. In all these expressions, the fiery aspect of Shiva is obvious.It is a matter for thought that the name Rudra is in sharp contrast to the name Shiva in terms of the meanings suggested by these words. While the term Rudra embodies in it a terrible aspect by denoting the roaring storm, the term Shiva points out to the benign aspect of Shiva. 
                                            Thus, these two terms together bring the contrasting features of Shiva put in one expression.</p>

                                        <p><strong> The Origin Of Rudra </strong></p>
                                        <p>Back in the days when Gods walked freely between the Heaven and the earth; when deities fought for justice and light, Indra, the god of thunder, ruled the deities in a city called Amrawati Puri. In one such battle, the rakshasas were able to defeat Indra and his army of gods and they forced Gods to flee from the city. The deities were full of fear and out of despair, they went to Maharishi Kashyap’s Ashram (a residence, also functioning as school). He happened to be the father of Indra.

                                            In the meeting, the King of Gods, now dethroned, told the entire story to his father. Kashyap was furious at the deeds of the rakshasas. Maharishi was known for his supreme knowledge and his ability to meditate. Thus, He consoled the god and promised that he would find a solution to the problem.
                                            
                                            Maharishi set off to Kashipuri with the motive to meditate and seek an audience with the celestial entity Shiva himself. After reaching Kashipuri, he established a Shiva-Linga (a cylindrical shaped shrine representing Shiva) and started to meditate in its presence, by chanting his name. After meditating for quite some time, Shiva appeared in front of him. He seemed impressed by Kashyap’s meditation and asked the Maharishi to make a wish.
                                            
                                            Kashyap remembered the dire condition of the gods. He then told Shiva that the rakshasas had defeated the gods, and had taken over the city of Amrawati Puri. He asked Shiva to be born as his son, to offer justice to the gods and take the place in the city as their protector. Shiva granted his wish by uttering the words, “Tathastu!” (So be it). In ecstasy, Kashyap showed his piety to the entity, and he disappeared.
                                            
                                            Maharishi returned to his ashram and explained the entire incident to the gods. They were pleased to hear everything. In time, Kashyap impregnated his wife, Surabhi, who then gave birth to 11 sons. These were the forms of the celestial entity Shiva and were known as Rudras. With their birth, the entire world, including the gods, Kashyap and his wife were pleased.</p>

                                    According to the Vedic belief the Jupiter God had presented them with a divine gem with which Ashvini kumar used to protect the agriculture.
                                    
                                    Ashvni kumar were the physician of the deities who relieved them from diseases, got them their sight and gave energy to the weak bodies.</p></span>

                                    According to the Puranas, Vishwakarma’s daughter and Suryadev (sun) wife Sangya was their mother.Sangya could not bear the lustre of the Suryadev (Sun) and so she left her shadow in the service of Suryadev and went for devout austerity.
                                    When Lord Surya came to know about the originality of Sangya’s shadow named  Chhaya so he went in search of Sangya. In the north
                                    Kurwa regions jungle, he found Sangya in the form of a mare in devout austerity.<br><br>
                                    Suryadev also changed himself into a horse.
                                    This Sangya, in the form of a mare and Suryadev in the form of a horse gave birth to twin children named Ashvini kumar. Their real names were Dasra and Nasatya.
                                    The Ashvinis are described as being handsome twins, one light and the other dark in colour and on a horse back.
                                    They are depicted as the drivers and the horses for the Suryadev chariot.
                                    They are symbolized by two circles, two mountain peaks, two eyes or two wheels. 
                                    In astrology, they represent the zodiac sign Gemini.<br><br>
                                    With great efforts Ashvini kumar gained expertise in medical science and become famous as physician of the deities.
                                    Ashvini kumar got fame because they granted manhood to Sage Chyavan. Chyavan, one of the Rigveda’s Sages with mystic knowledge, in his old age got married to Sukanya who was the daughter of the King Sharyati.
                                    But due to the old age he was not capable to enjoy the pleasure of a married man.

                                    Ashvini kumar gave him a divine medicine with which Chyavan attained permanent youth. ‘Chyavanprash’, the nutritious Ayurvedic medicine which is very famous today is named after Sage Chyavan. 
                                    Other patients of the Ashvinidev were Vispala (the racing mare), for whom they fitted an iron leg and Upamanyu (Vedic Rishi of Kamboja lineage) who had his eyesight restored.
                                    From the times of Mahabharata, the two brother Nakul and Sahadev of the five Pandavas born to Madri are said to be sons of Ashvini kumar. According to the Ramayana, Ashvinidev were the fathers of the monkeys, Dvivida and Mainda.

                                    <p><strong>Thus Shiva represents the body with life and motion.</strong><br>
                                        If the 'ee' is removed from Shiva, it gets reduced to sha+va or Shava which means a lifeless body. Anything with Shiva is with life, and anything without Shiva is Shava, or without life.<br>
                                        So Shiva is auspicious, Shiva is potential, and Shiva is life. Shiva is all encompassing - the universal soul or consciousness. Realizing this Shiva Tattva leads to Ananda (bliss).<br></p>
                                    <p><strong>Who is Shiva? What is Shiva Tattva?
                                    </strong><br>
                                    Shiva is the entire universe. He is in every atom of the universe.<br>
                                    Shiva doesn’t have a body, he was never a person at all. To symbolize the unfathomable, the infinite divinity, and to make it comprehensible for young people, for children and others, they made a form. In fact, there is no form to Shiva.<br>
                                    Shiva is a principle (Tattva) from where everything has come, everything is sustained in it, and everything dissolves into it. Shiva is the space, it is the consciousness.
                                    There is no way that you can even step out of Shiva at anytime because Shiva is the summum bonum of the whole creation. That is why Shiva’s body is depicted in blue because blue signifies the sky; the all pervading infinity which has no limits, and no shape<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The consciousness which is bliss and innocence, the consciousness which is the bestower of dispassion - is Shiva. The whole world is moving in an auspicious rhythm of innocence and intelligence - that is Shiva.
                                        The permanent and eternal source of energy, the eternal state of being, the one and only one - is Shiva.<br>
                                        <strong>The soul (of everything) is called Shiva – there is no difference between the soul and Shiva.</strong><br>
                                        It is a miracle how the same consciousness is present in every being in this creation! There is no other miracle greater than this.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <strong>It Has No Form Yet It Is In All Forms</strong><br>
                                        In the Rudra-abhishekam, it is said, 'Virupe-bhyo vishva-rupe bhyash-cha vo namo namah'.
                                        Virupe-bhyo means, that one which has no form and, Vishva-rupe-bhyo means, yet it is in all the forms of the universe.
                                        Everything, all forms are the manifestation of the formless Shiva. Shiva is the consciousness that present all over; it is an energy field.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <strong>It Never Began and It Will Never End</strong>
                                        Shiva is never born and he has no end. He is eternal. He is the fourth state of consciousness, known as the 'Turiya avasta' (the meditative state), that is beyond the waking, sleeping and dreaming state.<br><br>
                                        There is a beautiful story related to Shiva. Once Brahma the creator, and Vishnu the preserver of the Universe wanted to find Shiva and understand it completely. So Brahma said, I will go and look for his head and you find his feet. So for thousands of years Vishnu went down and down to find Shiva’s feet but couldn’t find it. Brahma went up and up to find his head but couldn’t find.
                                        The meaning here is, there is no feet and no head to Shiva. There is no beginning and no end to Shiva.
                                        Finally they both met at the middle and said that they couldn’t find either.

                                        This universe is Ananta vistara (of infinite expanse). The consciousness pervading this infinite universe is also infinite and is Agneya (not knowable). It is only lovable.<br>
                                    </p><br>

                                    <p><strong>How can you know Shiva?</strong></p>
                                    <strong>'Tapo yoga gamya'</strong> (a verse from Veda Saara Shiva Stotram by Adishankaracharya). He can be known through tapa (penance) and yoga.

                                     Through Omkaara you can know it, i.e., if you go deep into Omkara, the primordial sound of the Universe. Om is not something that you repeat. It is something that you hear.<br>
                                     <strong>How can you understand Shiva?</strong><br>
                                     <strong>'Shruti Gyan Gamyah'</strong>  (a verse from Veda Saara Shiva Stotram by Adishankaracharya). He can be understood through the knowledge of the shrutis* that you hear deep in meditation. Only through meditation; through the depth of the wisdom of the shrutis can you understand what Shiva is. Without yoga, Shiva can’t be experienced. Yoga doesn’t mean only asanas (physical postures) but yoga is that experience of Shiva which happens in meditation. It is when that ‘wow’ happens from within.<br><br>
                                     We have three states of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and there is a fourth state of consciousness where we are neither awake, nor dreaming, nor sleeping. It is a state where the mind is awake but the body is resting, and you know you are present, but do not know where you are - this is Shiva. And this state is experienced in meditation.
                                     If you start to enter that state where you are not dreaming or sleeping, you enter the state of samadhi, where you are free from worries.<br><br>
                                     So where should you search for the Shiva Tattva? Search for it in-between the states of waking and dreaming, or in-between deep sleep and waking, not far away in Mount Kailash.<br>
                                     When you are meditating, what is the experience that you have? It is neither waking nor sleeping. That glimpse of the fourth state is what is called Shiva Tattva. When you sit and meditate, you get in touch with the Shiva Tattva deep inside you. This state gives you the deepest rest possible that you can experience. The mind becomes fresh, delicate, beautiful and innocent.<br><br>

He is also known as Narayana and Hari. As one of the five primary forms of God in the Smarta tradition, he is conceived as “the Preserver or the Protector” within the Trimurti, the Hindu Trinity of the divinity.</p></span> <br>

                                    Vishnu is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and, along with Brahma and Shiva, is considered a member of the holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism. He is the most important god of Vaishnavism, the largest Hindu sect. Indeed, to illustrate Vishnu’s superior status, Brahma is, in some accounts, considered to have been born from a lotus flower which grew from Vishnu’s naval. A complex character, Vishnu is the Preserver and guardian of men (Narayana), he protects the order of things (dharma) and, when necessary, he appears on earth in various incarnations or avatars to fight demons and fierce creatures and so maintain cosmic harmony.

                                    Vishnu represents Sattvaguna and is the centripetal force as it were, responsible for sustenance, protection and maintenance of the created universe.

                                    Etymologically speaking, the word ‘Vishnu’ means ‘one who pervades, one who has entered into everything.’ So he is the transcendent as well the immanent reality of the universe. He is the inner cause and power by which things exist.<br><br>

                                <p>
                                    Vishnu resides in the milky waters of Vaikunth on a bed made of the coils of the thousand hooded great serpent, Adishesha of infinite dimensions. Goddess Lakshmi, his consort attends upon him. Symbolically the ocean stands for bliss and consciousness, the serpent for time, diversity, desire and illusion, and the goddess Lakshmi for the material things and powers of the creation.

                                    The colour of Vishnu is the colour of a dark blue cloud. It is the colour of the sky, denoting his cosmic dimensions and his connection with the Vedic gods of rain and thunder and his relationship with the earth. He is usually depicted with one face, four arms, usually in a standing posture or in a resting posture. He wears a necklace made of the famous Kaustubha gem that rests on his left chest and another garland of flowers and gems by name Vaijayanti.<br><br>
                                </p>
                                <p>His four arms hold sankha (a conch), chakra (discus), gada (mace) and padma (lotus) respectively. The conch stands for the five elements, the sound of AUM, salagrama, goddess Lakshmi, the waters, purity and perfection. The discus is the terrible weapon of Vishnu which he used to destroy the evil and protect the righteous. It symbolically represents the light bearing sun, which illuminates and removes darkness. It also stands for higher consciousness which destroys all illusions. The mace represent the power of knowledge while the lotus symbolizes beauty, harmony, purity, water element, creation and self realization.<br></p>

                                <br><p><strong>The Birth of Brahma from the Naval of Vishnu</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    According to the Puranas, Brahma is a self-born from a lotus flower which grew from the navel of Vishnu at the beginning of the universe. Thus comes one of his names Nabhija (born from the navel). Another legend says that Brahma was born in water. In this he deposited a seed that later became the golden egg. From the golden egg, Brahma, the creator was born, as Hiranyagarbha. The remaining materials of this golden egg expanded into the Brahm-anda or Universe.

                                    Being born in water, Brahma is also called Kanja (born in water). Brahma is said also to be the son of the Supreme Being, Brahman and the female energy known as Prakrti or Maya.

                                </p><br>
                                <p><strong>The Great Hindu Trinity: The Trimurti-Shiva, Brahma & Vishnu</strong></p>

                                <p>
                                    Brahma is traditionally depicted with four heads, four faces and four arms. With each head he continually recites one of the four Vedas. He is often depicted with a white beard, indicating the near eternal nature of his existence. He is shown as having four arms, with none holding a weapon, unlike most other Hindu Gods. One of his hands is shown holding a scepter in the form of a spoon, which is associated with the pouring of holy ghee or oil into a sacrificial pyre - indicating the fact that Brahma is the lord of sacrifices. Another of his hands holds a water-pot (sometimes depicted as a coconut shell containing water). The significance of the water is that it is the initial, all-encompassing ether in which the first element of creation evolved. Brahma also holds a string of malas that he uses to keep track of the Universe's time. He also is shown holding the Vedas, and sometimes, a lotus flower.
                                </p>
                                <br><br><p>Another story in connection with Brahma's four heads is that when Brahma was creating the universe, he made a female deity known as Shatarupa (one with a hundred beautiful forms). Brahma became immediately infatuated. Shatarupa moved in various directions to avoid the gaze of Brahma. But wherever she went, Brahma developed a head. Thus, Brahma developed five heads, one on each side and one above the others.</p><br><br>

                                <p>In order to control Brahma, Shiva cut off the top head. Also, Shiva felt that Shatarupa was Brahma's daughter/son, being created by him. Therefore, Shiva determined, it was wrong for Brahma to become obsessed with her. He directed that there be no proper worship in India for the "unholy" Brahma. Thus, only Vishnu and Shiva continue to be worshipped, while Brahma is almost totally ignored. Ever since the incident, Brahma has been reciting the four Vedas in his attempt at repentance.<br><br>

                                   The Bhagavata Purana includes a story wherein the Brahma of our universe is called by Krishna to meet with the Brahmas of other worlds, some of which have many more than four heads, counting into the many thousands in some instances for Brahma's in control of universes much larger than our own.<br><br>

                                   Brahma's vehicle is a divine Swan. This divine bird is bestowed with a virtue called Neera-Ksheera Viveka or the ability to sep, this virtue indicates that one should learn to separate the good from the evil, then accept that which is valuable and discard that which is worthless or evil.<br>

                                <p>The Shakta tradition glorifies Devi, the consort of Shiva, as the World Mother who, as Shakti, is the energy giving power behind all creation. Shakti is shown in many forms. As Uma or Parvati, she is the gentle consort of Shiva. As Kamakshi or Rajarajeshwari she is the Great Mother. In the form of Durga she rides a tiger, the ego and arrogance that man must subdue. In her angry form she is Kali.

                                    The earliest term applied to the divine feminine, which still retains its popular usage, is Shakti.</p>    

                                <p><br><strong>What does Shakti mean?</strong></p>
                                <p>The word Shakti is used in a variety of ways ranging from its use as a way to illustrate the ultimate primordial creative power, to expressing the capacity or power of words to convey meaning. The word 'Shakti' is derived from the root 'shak,' meaning potency or the potential to produce, an assertion of Her inherent creative aptitude.</p> <br><br>
                                <p>All interpretations of the word 'Shakti' hold common one parameter, Power. Specifically, Shakti means Power, Force and Feminine Energy. She represents the fundamental creative instinct underlying the cosmos, and is the energizing force of all divinity, of every being and every thing. Devotees believe the whole universe to be a manifestation of Shakti, who is also known by her general name Devi, from the Sanskrit root 'div' which means to shine.</p><br><br>
                                <p>She is the gentle Hindu goddess, and is one of the most important deities of Hinduism. She is the mother goddess in Hinduism, and has many popular aspects. Along with Lakshmi and Saraswathi, she forms the trinity of Hindu goddesses (Tridevi). Parvati is the wife of the Hindu god Shiva, the sister of God Vishnu and the mother of Lord Vinayaka and Lord Muruga.</p>
