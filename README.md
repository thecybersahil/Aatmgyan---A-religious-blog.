# Aatmgyan-A-Religious-Blog.
A blog website which has religious knowledge of hinduism. 'Aatmgyan' as the name suggests, it helps one to find their inner self by practicing and knowing their 'Dharma' and the truth behind it.
I would highly appreciate the feedbacks and requests of any specific knowledge related to hinduism. Just mail your request to sahilsouravsharma@gmail.com and the blog will be updated within 24 hours.
